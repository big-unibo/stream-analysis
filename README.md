# BIG - Stream Analysis

[![build](https://github.com/big-unibo/stream-analysis#big---project-template-stream-analysis/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/big-unibo/stream-analysis#big---project-template-stream-analysis/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## Multi-project gradle structure
    generator/   -- generator of stream data
    algorithms/  -- stream analysis algorithms implementations
    test/ -- test results
### Generator
The main class is `it.unibo.big.streamanalysis.generator.DatasetsGeneratorKt` (in Kotlin),
it generates the datasets and write them in test folder.

### Algorithms
The main class `it.unibo.big.streamanalysis.algorithm.app.AlgorithmsExecution` (written in Scala) is responsible for executing algorithms on datasets generated by a data generator. It handles the execution of various test configurations, primarily focusing on synthetic data denoted as `D_{syn}`, as described in the corresponding paper.

**Fixed Parameters:**
- **Alpha (α)**: 0.5
- **State Capacity**: 5%
- **k**: 2
- **Window Size**: 10,000 elements, split into 5 panes
- **Data Frequency**: 10,000 records per second

**Test Configurations:**
- Section 7.3:
  - **NAIVE Algorithm**: The NAIVE algorithm is executed using the fixed parameters.
- Section 7.4:
  - **ASKE Algorithm**: Several configurations are tested by varying specific parameters:
      1. **Varying Data Frequency**: ASKE is run by changing the data frequency from 1,000 records per second to 60,000 records per second, while maintaining the fixed parameters.
      2. **Varying Window Period**: ASKE is tested by changing the window period from 1,000 to 25,000, using the fixed parameters.
      3. **Varying k**: ASKE is executed with the fixed parameters, while changing `k` from 2 to 3.
      4. **Varying State Capacity**: ASKE is executed using the fixed parameters, while varying the state capacity from 1% to 10%.
- Section 7.5:
  - **Varying Alpha (α)**: ASKE is tested by varying the alpha parameter from 0.25 to 0.75, while using the fixed parameters.
  - **All Algorithms**: Finally, all algorithms are executed using the fixed parameters.


Then the results are stored in test folder and insights are retrieved with python code in `algorithms/src/main/python/it/big/unibo/query/paperTest.py`.

## How to run
It requires docker installed and running.

For run the test and obtain the results in the test folder, you can run the following command:

Linux:
```shell
./test.sh
```

Windows:
```shell
.\test.bat
```
